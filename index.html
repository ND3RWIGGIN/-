    <h2> 
Goth Kid: I guess you can join up with us if you want.
<br>
Goth Kid 2: Yeah. We're gonna go to the graveyard and write poems about death and how pointless life is.
<br>
Butters: Uh, uhm no thanks. I love life.
<br>
Stan: Huh? But you just got dumped.
<br>
Butters: Well yeah, and I'm sad, but at the same time I'm really happy that something could make me feel that sad. It's like, it makes me feel alive, you know? It makes me feel human. And the only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt somethin' really good before. So I have to take the bad with the good, so I guess what I'm feelin' is like a, beautiful sadness. I guess that sounds stupid.
<br>
Goth Kid 2: Yeah.
<br>
Stan: No. No, Butters, that doesn't sound stupid at all.
<br>
Butters: Well, thanks for offering to let me in your clique, guys, but, to be honest, I'd rather be a crying little pussy than a faggy Goth kid.</h2>
